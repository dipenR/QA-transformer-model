# QA-transformer-model
This project uses 
1. GRU, and
2. BERT 
to train a question answering model.

The data provides a question as well as a corpora of text containing the answer, the model produces a True or False label. The GRU model is implemented using pytorch and the sentence embeddings are produced using Gensim. The transfomer model is trained using BERT.
